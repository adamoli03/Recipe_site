    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the rice, either in the pot or in a rice-cooker. I will be using a rice-cooker, because then there is no need for supervision</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, chop up the mushrooms. Depending on taste you can use the stems too. Try to cut them thin or to small pieces.</li>
        <li>After that, we can make our delicious sauce: Heat up a little oil in the pan</li>
